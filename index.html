                <h1>Violence in <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em></h1>
                <p>by Shreyas Mayya</p>
                <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> Mark Twain criticizes violence in <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, painting it as cruel, harmful, and often unnecessary. He makes extensive use of auditory imagery to depict the sounds of violence and the negative effects that violence can have on people.</p>

                    <h3>Pap’s altercations with Huck demonstrate how damaging violence can be to interpersonal relationships.</h3>
                    <p>Huck doesn’t especially care for his father to begin with, but Pap’s violent nature angers his son even more, further weakening their relationship in the process. Huck starts doing things to spite Pap, such as going to school, even though he “didn’t want to go to school much before”, and regularly attempting to outmaneuver his father. One notable violent instance occurs when a drunk Pap attacks Huck at night, with the latter saying, “He chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn’t come for him no more.” The incident, which Twain describes using words like “screechy”, “roared”, and “cussed” to show Pap’s manic state, terrifies Huck so thoroughly that he is forced to aim a loaded gun at his own father out of self-preservation. While the relationship between father and son is already strained, Pap’s abusive personality and propensity to act violently upsets Huck greatly and plays a large role in his decision to fake his own death and run away.</p>

                    <h3>The violence between the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons is completely unnecessary—neither side gains anything from perpetuating it and they just sacrifice their loved ones in the process.</h3>
                    <p>When asked why he wants to kill Harney Shepherdson, Buck Grangerford responds, “Why, nothing—only it’s on account of the feud.” But what even is the feud between the two families? Buck certainly doesn’t know, and he reckons that not even the older family members are sure at this point. The only thing perpetuating the pointless dispute thirty years later is inertia. Despite the lack of good reasons to continue, the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons are happy to keep firing away at each other, sacrificing themselves and their loved ones in the name of the feud. Twain uses onomatopoeia to evoke the sounds of the fight with the “bang! bang! bang!” of the Shepherdsons’ guns, and he writes of the men yelling, “Kill them! Kill them!”—a sign of both sides’ willingness to eradicate the other over something useless that neither truly understands.</p>

                    <h3>Twain uses the needless killing of Boggs to depict how violence can ruin communities, as well as question people’s inclination toward physical actions.</h3>
                    <p>Boggs may be a rather rowdy drunkard, but the community generally considers him “the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw—never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober”, which is why it comes as such a shock when Colonel Sherburn shoots him dead in broad daylight. Twain’s writing is filled with auditory imagery here, including the “bang!” of the shots, the sobs of Boggs’s grieving daughter, and the dying man’s last gasps, followed by the “a-whooping and raging” of the townspeople on their way to lynch Sherburn. It’s clear that the violent act does immediate damage to the community at large, as they immediately turn on one of their own for committing the crime, harming relations among one another. Twain also illustrates how common the use of physical force is in the Arkansas town. Sherburn’s only warning is an ultimatum that a drunkard like Boggs won’t be able to comprehend, followed by shooting and killing Boggs for no crime other than being an annoyance. Following Boggs’s death, the townspeople decide to go kill Sherburn, showing their own tendencies toward violence. Twain’s negative portrayal of everything that goes on in the town indicates that he is somewhat of a pacifist who doesn’t believe in the need for violence in solving disputes.</p>

                    <h3>Twain takes the stance in the tarring and feathering scene that no one deserves to be the target of violence.</h3>
                    <p>Huck is just as much of a victim of the con-men as anyone: although he’s aware almost the whole time that they’re not whom they claim to be, he’s still forced to degrade himself for their luxury, as well as made to give them his money. Worst of all, they sell away Jim, Huck’s devoted friend, despite their promises not to do so. Despite all this, when Huck sees them, tarred and feathered, being ridden out on a rail with everyone around them “whooping and yelling, and banging tin pans and blowing horns”, he feels “sorry for them poor pitiful rascals”. “Human beings can be awful cruel to one another,” Huck observes, and this sentence succinctly encapsulates Twain’s point here: good or bad, no one truly deserves to be the victim of violence. Through all the scenes seen here and more, he makes his case through the sights and sounds of violent acts—the noise of guns, the yells of an attacker—as well as the carnage that violence leaves behind, like a dying man’s last breaths and the fear of a young boy, illustrating how violence can be highly destructive and often needless.</p>
